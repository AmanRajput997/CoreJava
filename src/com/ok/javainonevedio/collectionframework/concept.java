    /* What is collection Framework ?
       --> It provides a set of interface and classes that help in managing groups of object.
       --> Collection FrameWork was introduced in JDK 1.2.
       --> Before th introduction of the Collection Framework in JDK1.2, Java used to rely ona variety of classes like
           Vector, Stack, Hashtable, and Arrays to store and manipulate groups of objects.
           @ However, these classes had several drawbacks(VECTOR, STACK, HASHTABLE, ARRAYS)
           >> Inconsistency
           >> Lack of inter-operability
           >> No Common interface
