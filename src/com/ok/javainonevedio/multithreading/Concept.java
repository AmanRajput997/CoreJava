    Multithreading : The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions
                     from programs.
                     It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by instructions
        example : A modern CPU like the Intel Corei7 or AMD Ryzen 7
        ---> Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.
        ---> A web browser can use multithreading by having separate threads for rendering the page, running JavaScript,
             and managing user inputs. This makes the browser more responsive and efficient.
  * Core: a core is an individual processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple tasks simultaneously.
        example : A quad-core processor has four cores, allowing it to perform four tasks simultaneously. For instance,
                  one core could handle your browser, another music player, another a download manager, and another
                  a background system update.
    Program : A program is asset of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to
               perform a specific task
        example : Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.
    Process : A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the operating system
              creates a process to manage its execution
        example : AWhen we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process in the operating system.
  * Thread : A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which
             share the same resources but can run independently.
        example : a web browser like Google Chrome might use multiple threads for different tabs, with each tab running
                  as a separate thread
  * Multitasking : It allows on os to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single-core CPUs, this is done through
                   rapidly switching between tasks. Ont the multicore CPUs, true parallel execution occurs, with tasks
                   distributed across cores.
                   The Os scheduler balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance
        example : We are browsing the internet while listening to music and downloading a file.
        ---> Multitasking utilizes the capabilities of a CPU and its cores. When a operating system performs
             multitasking, it can assign different tasks to different cores. This is more efficient than assigning all
             tasks to a single core.
        ---> Multitasking can be achieved through multithreading where each task is divided into threads that are
             managed concurrently.
                                  While multitasking typically refers to the running of multiple applications,
                                  multithreading is more granular, dealing with multiple threads within the same
                                  application or process.
