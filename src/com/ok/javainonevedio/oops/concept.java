    /*OOPS (Object - Oriented Programming System)
        --> A programming papradigm that uses objects ans classes to design and implement software solutions
    Key Concepts of OOPS in Java
    1.Class
    2.Object
    3.Encapsulation
    4.Inheritance
    5.Polymorphism
    6.Abstraction
    1.)Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects.It defines the structure(fields) and behavior(methods) of Objects.
    2.)Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has attributes and behaviors.
    3.)Encapsulation: It is the practice of bunding data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit(class).
                      It also involves restricting direct access to some components using access modifiers(eg.,private, protected).
    4.)Inheritance: It allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class. It supports code reusability.
                    Types of Inheritance
                    * Single
                    * Multilevel
                    * Hierarchical
    --->[Java Doesn't support Multiple inheritance]
    5.)Polmorphism: It aloows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that calls them.
                    -->Same name but different parameters
      It can be achieved via:
      * Runtime Polymorphism(Method Overriding) or Dynamic Polmorphism
      * Compile-time Polymorphism(Method Overloading)
    6.)Abstraction: It focuses on showing only essential details while hiding the implementation. It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces
       Abstract Class: * Declared using the abstract keyword.
                       * Can include both abstract methods(methods without a body) and concrete methods(methods with body).
                       * Cannot be instantiated directly
                       * Acts as a blueprint for subclasses, which must implement the abstract methods.
      IMPORTANT THING
      * Class--> Blueprint for Object
      * Interface--> Blueprint for class
      Interface:-> We acheive abstraction and multiple inheritance.
                   It can have abstract methods, static constants, [static methods and default method].These two things comes after java 8
                   We can not make objects of Interface
         Static Methods in Interface:
         -- Used for utility operations that are RELATED to interface but don't need instance state
         -- Cannot be overridden by implementing classes
         -- Called directly on the interface (not through instance)
